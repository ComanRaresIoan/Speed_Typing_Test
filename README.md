3. Random Sentence Generation:
The game loads sentences from a file named "sentences.txt" and randomly selects one for the user to type.

4. Feedback:
During gameplay, the user receives real-time feedback on the accuracy of their typing and their current typing speed.
Upon completing typing the sentence, the game displays the results, including the time taken, accuracy, and WPM.

5. Graphics:
The game features graphics such as background images and icon images for visual appeal.
It uses different colors for various UI elements like text, input box, and result display.

6. Event Handling:
The game handles user events such as mouse clicks and keyboard input to control the flow of the game.
It listens for events like mouse button clicks, key presses, and window close events.

7. Performance:
The game runs at approximately 60 frames per second (FPS) to ensure smooth gameplay.

Overall, this code provides a functional typing speed test game with basic features like displaying sentences, calculating typing speed, and providing feedback to the user. However, there might be areas for improvement or additional features that could enhance the gameplay experience.
